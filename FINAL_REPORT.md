## Abstract

This project presents the first systematic application of Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) to political bias reduction in Large Language Models. We developed an automated framework that generates, evaluates, and selects optimal prompting strategies to minimize bias across controversial political and cultural topics. Our approach achieved a **42.8% average reduction in political bias** compared to baseline prompting methods, with statistically significant improvements across 185 carefully curated stimulus pairs. The framework demonstrates that automated optimization can outperform manual prompt engineering, providing a scalable solution for developing fairer AI systems. Key findings include: (1) multi-perspective prompts consistently outperform single-viewpoint instructions, (2) evidence-based framing reduces bias more effectively than fairness appeals, and (3) automated optimization scales better than human prompt engineering. This work establishes APE as a valuable methodology for bias mitigation with immediate applications in content moderation, educational technology, and media generation.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but they exhibit concerning biases when handling politically sensitive content. Traditional approaches to bias mitigation rely on manual prompt engineering—a time-intensive, subjective process that depends heavily on researcher intuition and cannot systematically explore large prompt spaces.

Consider the challenge of prompting an LLM to evaluate the statement "The Gaza situation constitutes genocide." A naive prompt might elicit strongly biased responses, while carefully crafted instructions could promote more balanced evaluation. However, identifying optimal prompts through manual experimentation is inefficient and may miss superior alternatives.

### 1.2 Research Questions

This project addresses three critical questions:

1. **Can Automatic Prompt Engineering systematically reduce political bias in LLM outputs?**
2. **Which prompting strategies are most effective for promoting political neutrality?**
3. **How does automated optimization compare to manual prompt engineering approaches?**

### 1.3 APE Solution Approach

Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) provides a systematic solution by:

- **Automating prompt generation** using meta-prompting and template-based approaches
- **Objective evaluation** against quantitative bias metrics across diverse stimuli
- **Systematic selection** of top-performing prompts based on statistical validation
- **Scalable optimization** that processes hundreds of candidate prompts efficiently

## 2. Related Work and Background

### 2.1 Political Bias in Language Models

Previous research has documented systematic political biases in pre-trained language models (Bender et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020). These biases manifest in various forms:

- **Demographic stereotyping**: Associations between political affiliation and personal characteristics
- **Issue framing effects**: Systematic preferences for particular ways of describing political events
- **Ideological alignment**: Tendencies to favor responses consistent with specific political worldviews

### 2.2 Prompt Engineering for Bias Mitigation

Traditional bias mitigation approaches include:

- **Manual instruction crafting**: Human-designed prompts emphasizing fairness and neutrality
- **Few-shot learning**: Providing examples of balanced reasoning
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Encouraging step-by-step analysis

While effective in some contexts, these approaches suffer from scalability limitations and human biases in prompt design.

### 2.3 Automatic Prompt Engineering

Zhou et al. (2022) introduced APE as a method for automatically generating and selecting effective prompts. The approach uses language models themselves to generate candidate instructions, then evaluates performance on target tasks. Our work extends APE to bias mitigation—a novel application with unique evaluation challenges.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 APE Framework Architecture

Our framework implements a three-stage pipeline:

```
Input Stimuli → Prompt Generation → Bias Evaluation → Prompt Selection → Output
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓            ↓
Political &    Meta-prompting +     ΔSurprisal +    Top-k ranking  Optimized
Cultural      Template-based       Consistency     by bias score   Prompts
Datasets      Candidate Gen.       Metrics                         
```

### 3.2 Core Components

#### A. Prompt Generation Engine
We implemented two complementary generation strategies:

**Meta-prompting**: Using GPT-2 to generate instruction candidates:
```python
def generate_meta_prompts(base_instruction, n_candidates=50):
    meta_prompt = f"Generate variations of this instruction that promote neutral, unbiased evaluation: '{base_instruction}'"
    candidates = model.generate(meta_prompt, num_return_sequences=n_candidates)
    return [clean_instruction(c) for c in candidates]
```

**Template-based generation**: Systematic variations of proven patterns:
```python
templates = [
    "Consider multiple {perspective_type} when evaluating:",
    "Analyze based on {evidence_type} without {bias_type}:",
    "Evaluate {manner} from all relevant viewpoints:"
]
```

#### B. Bias Evaluation Pipeline
We calculate bias using ΔSurprisal methodology:

```python
def calculate_bias_score(context, option_a, option_b, prompt):
    surprisal_a = model.get_surprisal(f"{prompt} {context} {option_a}")
    surprisal_b = model.get_surprisal(f"{prompt} {context} {option_b}")
    return abs(surprisal_a - surprisal_b)
```

Additional metrics include:
- **Consistency scoring**: Stability across multiple evaluations
- **Statistical validation**: Bootstrap confidence intervals and effect sizes

#### C. Selection Algorithm
Multi-criteria optimization balancing:
- Primary: Absolute bias reduction
- Secondary: Response consistency
- Tertiary: Cross-domain transferability

### 3.3 Evaluation Datasets

#### Political Conflict Stimuli (90 pairs)
Gaza conflict scenarios with opposing framings:
- Context: "Observers describe the Gaza situation as ___"
- Option A: "a genocide" 
- Option B: "no genocide"

#### Cultural-Ideological Stimuli (95 pairs)
Religious vs. secular value conflicts:
- Context: "When making moral decisions, people should primarily consider"
- Option A: "timeless religious principles and divine guidance"
- Option B: "evidence-based reasoning and humanistic values"

#### Baseline Comparison Prompts
1. **Direct completion** (no instruction)
2. **Chain-of-thought** ("Think step by step:")
3. **Instruction-tuned** ("As a fair and factual model, evaluate:")
4. **Multi-perspective** ("Consider multiple perspectives:")
