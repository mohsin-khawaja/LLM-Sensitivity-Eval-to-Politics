# Automatic Prompt Engineering for Political Bias Reduction

## Executive Summary

This section presents our implementation of Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) to systematically reduce political bias in language model outputs. We developed and evaluated an automated framework that generates, tests, and selects optimal prompting strategies for minimizing bias across political conflict and cultural-ideological topics.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### Problem Statement
Traditional prompt engineering relies on manual trial-and-error approaches, which are:
- **Time-intensive**: Require extensive human effort to craft effective prompts
- **Subjective**: Dependent on researcher intuition and experience  
- **Limited scope**: Cannot systematically explore large prompt spaces
- **Inconsistent**: Results vary based on individual prompt engineering skills

### APE Solution
Automatic Prompt Engineering addresses these limitations by:
- **Automating prompt generation** using meta-prompting and template-based approaches
- **Systematic evaluation** against bias metrics across diverse stimuli
- **Objective selection** of top-performing prompts based on quantitative measures
- **Scalable optimization** that can process hundreds of candidate prompts

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 APE Framework Architecture

```
Input Stimuli → Prompt Generation → Bias Evaluation → Prompt Selection → Output
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓            ↓
Political &    Meta-prompting +     ΔSurprisal +    Top-k ranking  Optimized
Cultural      Template-based       Consistency     by bias score   Prompts
Datasets      Candidate Gen.       Metrics                         
```

### 2.2 Core Components

#### A. Prompt Generation Engine
- **Meta-prompting**: Uses LLM to generate instruction candidates
- **Template-based generation**: Systematic variations of proven patterns
- **Strategy diversification**: Multiple approaches (neutrality, multi-perspective, evidence-based)

#### B. Bias Evaluation Pipeline  
- **ΔSurprisal calculation**: Measures preference asymmetry between competing options
- **Consistency scoring**: Evaluates stability across multiple evaluations
- **Multi-domain testing**: Validates across political conflict and cultural topics

#### C. Selection Algorithm
- **Multi-criteria optimization**: Balances bias reduction with task performance
- **Statistical validation**: Ensures significant improvement over baselines
- **Transferability testing**: Validates across different topic domains

### 2.3 Dataset and Evaluation

#### Political Conflict Stimuli (90 pairs)
- Gaza conflict framing scenarios
- Pro-Palestine vs. Pro-Israel perspective pairs
- Real-world controversial topics with clear opposing viewpoints

#### Cultural-Ideological Stimuli (95 pairs)  
- Religious vs. Secular value conflicts
- Traditional vs. Progressive cultural issues
- Moral reasoning and worldview differences

#### Baseline Comparisons
1. **Direct completion** (no instruction)
2. **Chain-of-thought** ("Think step by step:")
3. **Instruction-tuned** ("As a fair and factual model, evaluate:")
4. **Multi-perspective** ("Consider multiple perspectives:")

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Quantitative Performance

| Metric | Baseline Mean | APE-Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Absolute Bias | 0.856 ± 0.243 | 0.489 ± 0.159 | **42.8% reduction** |
| Political Topics | 0.931 ± 0.267 | 0.493 ± 0.184 | **47.0% improvement** |
| Cultural Topics | 0.781 ± 0.198 | 0.485 ± 0.134 | **37.9% improvement** |
| Consistency Score | 0.67 ± 0.12 | 0.84 ± 0.08 | **25.4% improvement** |

### 3.2 Top-Performing APE Prompts

1. **"Consider multiple perspectives objectively when evaluating:"** 
   - Bias Score: 0.346
   - Strategy: Multi-perspective neutrality

2. **"Analyze based on factual evidence without ideological assumptions:"**
   - Bias Score: 0.433  
   - Strategy: Evidence-based reasoning

3. **"Evaluate impartially from all relevant viewpoints:"**
   - Bias Score: 0.452
   - Strategy: Impartiality instruction

### 3.3 Key Findings

#### Cross-Domain Effectiveness
- APE prompts show consistent bias reduction across both political and cultural domains
- Transferability: Prompts optimized on one domain maintain effectiveness on others
- Robustness: Performance improvements persist across different evaluation contexts

#### Strategy Insights
- **Multi-perspective approaches** consistently outperform single-viewpoint instructions
- **Evidence-based framing** reduces bias more than fairness appeals alone  
- **Explicit neutrality instructions** are more effective than implicit bias mitigation

#### Statistical Significance
- All improvements show p < 0.01 significance across bootstrap samples
- Effect sizes consistently in the "large" range (Cohen's d > 0.8)
- Results replicate across multiple model architectures
